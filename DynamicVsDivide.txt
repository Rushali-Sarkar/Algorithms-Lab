Divide and Conquer approach basically means to divide the problem into several subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem and then attempt to conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, we just solve the sub-problem in a straightforward manner. After we have divided the problem into smaller subproblems and conquered the subproblems we combine these solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem. Recurrences go hand in hand with the divide and conquer paradigm, because they give us a natural way to characterize the running times of divide and conquer algorithms. A recurrence is an equation or inequality that describes a function in terms of value on smaller inputs.
